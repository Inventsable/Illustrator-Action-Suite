# ActionSuite

Extended Action classses for the Illustrator Scripting API

## Getting started

There is no simple module/package/library distribution for JSX scripting, so unfortunately this file would need to be manually included in any project or script requiring it:

```js
// At the top of any JSX script
#include "./ActionSuite.js" // Relative path to file
```
